I made plenty of great friends, had great teachers and had an overall great experience! MCCC was the school for me! The teachers and instructors at Medina County Career Center are incredible and make the labs even better! I was absolutely baffled by how much more enjoyable Medina County Career Center is compared to traditional high school. Everything I experienced – academics, teachers and classmates – was better than the public high school I attended prior. Medina County Career Center will change your life and give you the opportunity to be the best version of yourself. I recommend Medina County Career Center because the school is the BEST thing you will ever experience. MCCC gives you the support you need to go into a career you are interested in and passionate about. The staff is like a big, happy family to me. I couldn’t ask for a better career tech school! My daughter is a senior in the Criminal Justice program and loves it! It definitely sets them up on a path for a career in their field when they graduate. My daughter is getting ready to start an internship in Strongsville for dispatching. Best choice I ever made was to go to MCCC. I had so much opportunity to get duel credits. Earn internships. Get my foot in the door to multiple companies immediately after my certification. I got hired in at 16 from my internship and it sky rocketed from there. The Medina County Career Center is one of the top rated career centers in Ohio. My son graduated a couple years ago and already opened his own company and works for another large company and does very well at age 19. My younger daughter is graduating this year and even though she went into the digital design program, she is going to come back after she graduates to do the medical assisting program, which will be covered for free. She also got accepted and will start into a college with a scholarship for biology and forensics (after she completes her Medical assisting) While at the career center she’s also been taking CCP courses and also completed, like my son did, an internship when they were 17 years old, which already put them way ahead of their peers in the other school districts. I would not be where I am in life today if I had not gone to the Medina County Career Center. I loved graduating at 17 with my high school diploma, everything I needed to attend college, and a Cosmetology license. I started working in a salon my senior year, and I’ve just kept going! This is my 37th year as a hairstylist and 24th year as a salon owner at Salon Evangeline. The MCCC helped guide me to where I am today. I have a successful job thanks to them and still think about my education there, and use it to this day. My twin sister can say the same. I took DMT and she took Cosmetology. I was able to obtain college credits which in turn shortened the amount of classes I had to take in college. Best decision I ever made! I hated the high school and did horrible freshman and sophomore year but switched to the Career Center for Junior and my grades improved and I actually liked going! Medina County Career Center lived up to all of my expectations and I loved it here! Medina County Career Center was the best thing I ever did. I absolutely love this place! The teachers are so nice and care about your success. It feels great. I love this place – change nothing! Attending Medina County Career Center was one of the best decisions I ever made! Medina County Career Center will change your life in the most beautiful way! The staff and teachers are amazing. The programs truly immerse you in the subject material. Even if you decide not to continue with your program of choice after high school, the sheer amount of knowledge and experience you gain from attending MCCC will help you in any career you choose. I cannot express how thankful I am for MCCC. I would highly recommend attending this institution! I was in that [Diversified Medical Technologies] program in 1993… I’m currently a 3rd year PhD student at Texas Tech. My experience at MCCC was life changing and I am a proponent of vocational education. I’m a 2005 graduate from their animal care program. I love the MCCC! I went into an early work placement my senior year at a veterinary clinic. I then went to college and obtained my associate’s degree in veterinary technology and applied sciences. I passed my boards and became a registered veterinary technician in 2008. I’ve worked in general practice, alpaca farms, horse farms, low cost shelter med, Medvet specialty hospital as a surgery tech and helped out in their neurology and ER departments as well. I highly recommend [MCCC}. Prepares the student for real life experiences, helps them set up for adulthood & teaches them real-life career responsibilities. We are so lucky to have this education offered to our high school students. My daughter did Criminal Justice at MCCC! Absolutely loved it there. She graduated last year and is in college at Ashland University. Because of her being the criminal justice program at MCCC she is currently a junior at college and on her way to getting her Bachelors degree. They really do amazing things for our kid s! Idk anyone that didn’t get massive amounts of positivity from there experience. Staff is amazing and they treat you as an adult. My 3 older kids all graduated from the career center. All of them loved it and flourished when they were there. Grade wise and friends wise. One son took auto tech, one son took carpentry and my daughter took criminal justice. All were great programs. I can’t recommend MCCC enough!! One of the best choices I’ve ever made. I graduated in 2014 from the Sports Medicine and Exercise Science Program. I was able to earn a total of 17 college credits during my junior and senior year. Stayed involved with my home school, played sports, and graduated with honors. Since graduating, I’ve gone on to earn a bachelor’s and doctoral degree in Physical Therapy and founded my own private PT practice here in Medina. Couldn’t have done it without the amazing schooling, guidance, and support I received from MCCC!

Students may have the opportunity to start their field experience earlier if approved by their instructor.

Allow three weeks into a new quarter when assessing at the beginning of a quarter. Reference the previous quarter’s grades if assessing a student at the beginning of a quarter. Once students are on placement: Grades should be checked on the 1st and 15th of each month. If a student falls below these requirements, there will be a one-week grace period for the student to improve/create an improvement plan. If improvement is not shown, the student is removed from placement and good academic standing will have to be maintained for two consecutive weeks before being eligible to return to placement.

Philosophy In this day of rapidly expanding and ever changing technology, it is extremely important that the District have an adequate facility and programs to meet the present and future vocational needs of the adults of the Medina County community. The responsibilities for assisting students beyond high school, on the job, for additional training and education, military service or post-secondary counseling, should remain an on-going obligation of the staff. Programs are structured to provide the foundation on which adults may build their future lives. As a part of this overall foundation, it is vitally important to provide a wide variety of program selections and specific training in the occupations which best fit the students’ abilities, interests, and needs. Although actual experience in preparation for the world of work is of the utmost importance, it is important to develop a sense of responsibility as it pertains to citizenship in a democratic society. Due to the rapidly changing technology and the mobility of people in this society, the District must provide opportunities for the training and retraining of adults as their jobs change drastically or become obsolete. District Mission Statement We are a learning community providing students with a competitive advantage through career technical education and academic excellence. Office Hours Monday – Thursday 8:00a-8:00p, Friday 8:00a-3:00p Registration is open through the first week of classes on a space-available basis.

However, students may enroll without a diploma or GED if they are participating in the Adult Diploma Program (applies to approved programs only) or complete a High School Equivalence Diploma before program graduation. Students that are foreign nationals and not able to provide proof of a high school diploma, may graduate if they attain a composite score of 14 on the WorkKeys tests. Students must pass the TABE assessment test (see Admission Procedure). ADMISSION PROCEDURE Review program information, job outlook, graduation rates, median debt of students who completed the program and other important information, and speak with an Adult Education staff member to answer any questions.

Once you have received your Student Aid Report (SAR), schedule an appointment with the Director of Adult Education to review your eligibility for financial assistance. If you do not have access to a computer or would like help, contact the Adult Education Office at (330) 725-8461, ext. 155.

Withdrawn students who qualify for outside scholarships and aid may also be held responsible for the difference between award amount and balance due to MCCC.

There is no guarantee that transfer of credit is accepted, unless met by the stated guidelines. Acceptance of a transfer credit for a course completed in other post-secondary institutions, when comparable in scope to the coursework offered, may be granted based on meeting the following factors: Comparability of the nature, content, and level of transfer of credit and the appropriateness and applicability of the credit earned to programs offered by Medina County Career Center are determining factors in the evaluation process for transfer credit to be awarded. The student must also meet the acceptable standards of educational accomplishment through a given assessment selected by the instructor or program coordinator according to the offered course module (must obtain a 70% or better). The assessment will reflect a valid evaluation measure to represent student learning outcomes applicable to that transfer of credit that is reflective of the coursework offered within the Career Development program. The course must align with the curriculum, materials, and topics covered in the Medina County Career Center course. Evidence of appropriate academic level may also be requested showing satisfactory grades for the course completed as well as a request of the syllabus or study guide for the course. Due to all career development programs commencing concurrently, the Medina County Career Center does not permit transfers between programs, once the school year has started. The decision to accept an academic transfer of credit will include the Director of Adult Education, Program Coordinator, and instructors of Medina County Career Center. PART-TIME CLASSES Student Handbook ELIGIBILITY Admission is open to anyone 16 years or older (unless otherwise noted in the catalog) regardless of educational background. Students attending a full-time high school must have the permission of their High School Principal and the Director of Adult Education.

The issue was resolved with a first level intervention. The intervention involved collaboration with a Principal, the Student Assistance Specialist, the program instructor, and the student, and close monitoring of the student’s interaction with his peers. HIB comments and behaviors were addressed directly until they stopped. The issue was resolved.

Break the Silence…Prevent the Event Use the Safe School Helpline to report threats of violence, suicide and illegal activity that could harm children in our school. Your call is private, confidential, and anonymous. The Medina County Career Center subscribes to a service that allows students and parents to relate this information anonymously. We hope the information outlined here will answer your questions and ease your mind – so you can help keep our school a safe place to learn. 1-800-418-6423 ext. 359 www.safeschoolhelpline.com How do we know it is anonymous? We have contracted for this service through Security Voice, an outside company with no ties to our school. How does it work? A toll-free number has been assigned for our school district. When you dial this number from a touch-tone phone, you will be advised how to leave your information – and not to include your name or other facts that could identify you. Then, record your message. You may also report an incident or concern through the Safe Helpline Online Reporting form . What type of information should be reported? Please report any facts, remarks or actions that could jeopardize the safety of our children, staff or school. Examples of harmful or threatening behavior might include: Violence Bullying Theft Drug or alcohol abuse Talk of suicide Sexual harassment Weapons What happens next? Security Voice will send a typed copy of your message to the school. The school will then investigate the report, and determine how best to act on it. When and where can I call? You may call toll-free anytime, day or night – from a home, cell or pay phone. Take care that your call is not overheard. Can this service help troubled students, too? Yes. If you see a student who is very troubled, or overhear remarks like “I can’t go on,’ please call to report it. The call will be routed to a Community Counseling and Crisis Center that provides a 24-hour crisis intervention service. Trained counselors are available 365 days per year to talk with persons seeking assistance in coping with suicidal thoughts, depression, or feelings of loneliness and loss. Callers need only press ‘3’ when prompted. Who can call this number? Everyone within our school district, including: Students Teachers Staff Parents Administrators Can I change my message later? How will you know who is calling? Yes. When you leave a message you are given a case number that is yours alone. Enter that same case number when updating your message or answering additional questions. How will I know if any action has been taken? After three school days, call the toll-free number and enter your case number when prompted. A recording will let you know your message was heard and may ask you for more information. Your answers will be transcribed and sent to the school administration for further investigation. Administrative actions may sometimes be confidential, but your call is always important.

Our team is dedicated to providing and maintaining a robust, reliable, and secure infrastructure that enhances the teaching and learning experience. Our goal is to support a learning environment where students, teachers, and staff have safe, secure, and reliable access to technology that fosters creativity, critical thinking, and higher learning. We believe that technology is a vital resource, empowering students and teachers with the tools needed to operate efficiently and effectively. We are committed to upholding all applicable regulatory acts, such as the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) to ensure compliance and safeguard our users’ privacy. By consistently maintaining our equipment and software and implementing timely upgrades to meet current standards, we ensure our technology remains effective and prepared for future needs. Acceptable Use Policy Internet Filtering Student Devices Student Privacy Acceptable Use Policy The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for technology outlines the guidelines and expectations for responsible and ethical use of district-provided technology resources. This policy applies to students, staff, and faculty and emphasizes the importance of using technology in ways that are safe, legal, and aligned with educational goals. The AUP prohibits any actions that could compromise the security, integrity, or functionality of the network and forbids inappropriate content, cyberbullying, and unauthorized access. By adhering to the AUP, users contribute to a secure and supportive digital environment that promotes productive and respectful use of technology for learning and communication. Computer/Online Services (Acceptable Use and Internet Safety) Policy Internet Filtering As a receiver of Federal E-Rate monies, Medina County Career Center (MCCC) must by law provide internet content filtering to any and all connections made from our school district network, and from district-owned devices. To comply with federal law, MCCC employs internet content filtering and monitoring. However, no internet content filtering system can be fully effective in preventing access to harmful and inappropriate material. With global access to computers and people, there is a risk that students may access material that may not be considered to be of educational value in the context of the school setting. Users will not use MCCC resources to view or otherwise gain access to potentially objectionable materials. This includes text materials, video, images, or sound files that may be considered objectionable in an educational setting. If students mistakenly access inappropriate information, they should immediately disclose this access to their teacher or other supervising staff member. If a student finds that other users are visiting offensive or harmful sites, they should report such use to their supervising teacher. Vigilance, care, and guidance should always be used when students are using internet resources in the classroom. To ensure student protection, the Google Chrome browser has a Lightspeed extension installed. When users log in to Chrome with their MCCC account, the Lightspeed agent is automatically installed, regardless of the device or its location. To maintain privacy when off-campus and using a non-district device, please refrain from signing into your MCCC account in Google Chrome. Other browsers, such as Edge, Firefox, and Safari, are not impacted by this extension when off-campus. Despite the existence of MCCC policy, regulations and guidelines, it is virtually impossible to completely prevent access to content or material that may be considered inappropriate for students. Students may have the ability to access such content or material from their home, other locations off school premises and/or with a student’s own personal technology or electronic device on school grounds or at school events. If faculty, staff, students, or guests are using the MCCC’s “guest” wireless connection, content is filtered. However, users who possess smartphones with a third-party internet connection (i.e. Verizon) have their own connection to the internet, and thus bypass MCCC protection. MCCC is not responsible for inappropriate content or material accessed via a student’s own personal technology or device or via an unfiltered internet connection received through a student’s own personal technology or electronic device. Cybersecurity Awareness Program Parent and Educator Resources . Student Devices Students are permitted to use their associate school Chromebook or personal device to access MCCC resources. Chromebooks Because of MCCC’s diverse technologies, we are not a one-to-one school district. However, most of our associate schools provide Chromebooks to MCCC students. If an associate school does not provide MCCC students with a Chromebook and a device is needed to complete school-related activities off campus, a device may be requested through the student’s MCCC school counselor. Please see the following information for each associate school: Black River High School – Students are permitted to use a Black River-owned device while enrolled at MCCC. Students must login to the Chromebook with their Black River credentials and add their MCCC account to Google Workspace. Students must sign Black River’s district’s acceptable use policy and have the option to purchase Chromebook insurance. Please contact Black River High School for additional information. Brunswick High School – Please contact MCCC School Counselor Patrick Shaughnessy . Buckeye High School – Please contact MCCC School Counselor Monica Foelich . Cloverleaf High School – Students are permitted to use a Cloverleaf-owned device while enrolled at MCCC. Students can login to the Chromebook with their MCCC credentials. Students must complete a Cloverleaf form via Final Forms and pay a Cloverleaf technology fee each year to use the Chromebook. Please contact Cloverleaf High School for additional information. Highland High School – Students are permitted to use a Highland-owned device while enrolled at MCCC. Students can login to the Chromebook with their MCCC credentials. Please contact Highland High School for additional information. Medina High School – Students are permitted to use a Medina-owned device while enrolled at MCCC. Students can login to the Chromebook with their MCCC credentials. Students must complete a Medina High School form and pay a Medina High School technology fee each year to use the Chromebook. Please contact Medina High School for additional information. Personal Devices Students may bring personal devices on campus and connect to the MCCC BYOD WiFi account (e.g., [email protected] and MCCC password), yet must follow individual teachers’ use policy. Personal devices are not permitted to access the MCCC network to print documents or access network resources. MCCC is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged personal property. Student Privacy The Medina County Career Center is committed to technology accessibility and equity. Data Privacy Agreements (DPAs) serve as a crucial bridge between schools and educational technology vendors, outlining the terms and conditions for handling student data responsibly. Technology providers contracting with Medina County Career Center must comply with data privacy laws and limit their use of student data. Technology tools, curricula, and applications are extensively reviewed and approved before providing students access. Applications, curricula, and other online resources that do not comply are prohibited.

This process is a critical step in ensuring the institution continues to meet high standards of educational excellence and workforce training. The COE, located in Atlanta, Georgia, is a national accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, dedicated to ensuring the quality and integrity of career and technical education institutions. The reaffirmation of accreditation is a rigorous process that evaluates various aspects of the institution, including instructional quality, student services, administrative operations, and overall institutional effectiveness. Accreditation from the COE is essential for technical and career-focused institutions like the MCCC’s OTC, as it validates the quality of education and ensures compliance with federal and state regulations. As part of the accreditation process, the OTC will undergo a thorough review, including a self-study report and an on-site evaluation by COE representatives. This review assesses the effectiveness of the institution’s programs in preparing students for in-demand careers. The Medina County Career Center’s OTC plays a vital role in the local economy by providing hands-on training and certification programs tailored to the needs of employers in the region. With a focus on workforce development, the center helps individuals gain the necessary skills to secure employment or advance in their careers. Community members, students, and stakeholders are encouraged to participate in the reaffirmation process by providing feedback and support for the OTC’s accreditation efforts. Individuals wishing to provide feedback can write to the Executive Director of the Commission at the Council on Occupational Education, 7840 Roswell Road, Building 300, Suite 325, Atlanta, GA 30350, or submit their comments through the Council’s website at www.council.org . Commenters are required to provide their names and mailing addresses. The outcome of the accreditation review is expected to be announced following the completion of the evaluation process.

If you have visited the MCCC campus recently, you may have noticed that work has started on the new fire training facility, with the existing tower being taken down last month. Construction of the new facility is scheduled to begin soon and be completed in late Spring of 2025, enabling this year’s senior Firefighter | EMT students to experience the first live burn. The state-of-the-art training facility was championed by State Representative Sharon Ray, who secured the $1 Million in funding for the project and was initiated by MCCC Superintendent Steven Chrisman. Each year, MCCC educates 25 juniors and 25 seniors at the high school level, where they can earn Firefighter I, Firefighter II, and EMT Basic certifications. In addition, approximately 8-12 Adult Education students enroll each year in FFI, FFII, EMT, Transition to Firefighter, and 36-hour Volunteer Firefighter Training program s. In accordance with the MCCC’s ethos of service to the Medina County community, the 14 local fire departments in the county will have free-of-charge use of the new facility and were heavily involved in the facility’s design. Good training saves lives, and the MCCC and Representative Ray are ensuring that current and future first responders in Medina County will have access to top-notch fire training!

But do they have a place in school? Two Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics students set out to prove that they do, and became the driving force behind bringing Esports Ohio to the Medina County Career Center. Joey Bauer (BR) and Tyler Hennigan (BR), with the support of instructor Brad Wright, formulated a proposal to build Esports teams for their classroom and as a school-supported after school activity. The two compiled extensive research outlining the benefits of schoolwide engagement, team building and enhanced communication and critical thinking skills. Additionally, they cited the opportunity to participate in competition via Business Professionals of America and noted the availability of student scholarships. They developed a class survey and determined six team games that could be used, settling on Rocket League and Fortnite – both of which are free and rated for teen play in a school setting. They provided a detailed breakdown of the cost to MCCC for all equipment needed to support eight team members and even factored in the longevity of the proposed equipment. They enlisted the aid of school counselor Patrick Shaughnessy to look at creating an after-school program to bring together interested students from every MCCC career-technical program and established parameters for eligibility designed to promote good performance in school (all grades should be passing, good attendance and no missing assignments). In November 2023, Bauer and Hennigan made their formal presentation to Superintendent Steven Chrisman and ultimately gained approval for the MCCC Esports program. The equipment arrived early this fall! Beginning in January, interested students will be able to compete in after-school tournaments against other Ohio schools. Kudos to Joey and Tyler for taking the initiative and successfully planning, preparing, and presenting an idea that is sure to benefit all MCCC gaming enthusiasts.
